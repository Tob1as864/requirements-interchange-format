# Requirements Interchange Format (ReqIF)
Java classes to access Specifications &amp; Requirements stored in the Requirements Interchange Format (ReqIF)

This implementation of the Requirements Interchange Format currently uses http://www.lingala.net/zip4j/ for access to .reqifz files.

Fixed old library dependencies.
